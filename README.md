# Words
Words is a simple application that can be used to help test a child's development on [mental imagery and reading process](https://www.jstor.org/stable/999400). The application projects one random word on the screen from a compiled and categorized collection of words from [the Basic Spelling Vocabulary List](https://www.readingrockets.org/article/basic-spelling-vocabulary-list) at Reading Rockets. Words can be filtered on Grade, Length, and Difficulty, and can be generated automatically or at configurable speeds.
